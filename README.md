# To Do App Backend

The backend of a small To Do App project, acting as a bit of a playground for me to expand my knowledge into backend, ultimately growing as a full-stack developer.

This contains the APIs which will control the functionality of the frontend, separating the responsibility of the two systems. This will eventually be tied to a database to hold all the information regarding any added to dos, enabling the ability to view, add, edit and delete entries.
